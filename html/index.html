                    Tupac Amaru Shakur, also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper and
                    actor.
                    He is considered by many to have been one of the greatest hip hop artists of all time.
                </p>

                <p id="second">
                    Shakur was born in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City but relocated to Los
                    Angeles in 1988.
                    When he released his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West
                    Coast
                    hip hop,
                    introducing social issues in the genre at a time when gangsta rap was dominant in the
                    mainstream
                </p>

                <p id="third">
                    Shakur is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, amassing over 75 million estimated
                    global sales.
                    Much of Shakur's work has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued
                    inner
                    cities,
                    and he is considered a symbol of resistance and activism against inequities.
